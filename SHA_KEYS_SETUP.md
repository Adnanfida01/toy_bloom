# Firebase SHA Key Configuration Guide

To properly set up Firebase authentication with verification codes in ToyBloom, you need to generate and add SHA key hashes to your Firebase project.

## Why This Is Important

SHA keys are essential for:
- Email authentication workflows
- Phone number verification
- OAuth sign-in methods
- Firebase App Check

## Generating SHA-1 and SHA-256 Keys

### For Debug Key (Development)

1. Open a command prompt or terminal
2. For Windows, run:
   ```
   keytool -list -v -keystore "%USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
   ```

3. For Mac/Linux, run:
   ```
   keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
   ```

### For Release Key (Production)

1. Navigate to your keystore location
2. Run:
   ```
   keytool -list -v -keystore YOUR_KEYSTORE_PATH -alias your_key_alias -storepass YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD -keypass YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
   ```

## Adding SHA Keys to Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Click the gear icon ⚙️ for "Project settings"
4. Select the "Your apps" tab
5. Find your Android app and click "Add fingerprint"
6. Enter both the SHA-1 and SHA-256 values generated by keytool
7. Click "Save"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with authentication after adding SHA keys:
1. Make sure you've added both SHA-1 and SHA-256 keys
2. Verify that you're using the correct keystore for your build type (debug vs. release)
3. Rebuild and reinstall the app after adding the keys
4. Check Firebase Authentication logs for specific error messages
